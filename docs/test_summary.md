# Appointment Availability Script - Test Results Summary

## ✅ Test Results Overview

The appointment availability script has been thoroughly tested with the provided data and demonstrates robust functionality for the AI voice agent system.

## 🧪 Test Scenarios Covered

### 1. Basic Availability Checks
- **Available Time Slots**: ✅ Correctly identifies open slots
- **Conflicting Appointments**: ✅ Detects overlapping bookings
- **Provider Working Hours**: ✅ Validates against schedule constraints

### 2. Provider Schedule Validation
- **Dr. Leonhard Euler (Family Medicine)**: Works Tuesdays 10:00-16:00
- **Dr. John von Neeumann (Gastroenterology)**: Works Mondays 9:00-15:30
- **Weekend/Off-day Requests**: ✅ Properly rejects with next available suggestion

### 3. Conflict Detection Examples
```
Monday June 2nd - Dr. von Neeumann:
- 09:00 AM: ✅ Available
- 09:45 AM: ❌ Conflicts with 10:00 appointment → Next: 10:15 AM
- 10:00 AM: ❌ Exact conflict → Next: 10:15 AM
- 10:15 AM: ✅ Available
- 15:15 PM: ❌ Would end after closing → Next: 09:00 AM (next Monday)
```

### 4. Edge Cases Handled
- **Boundary Times**: Appointments at start/end of working hours
- **Invalid Formats**: Proper error messages for malformed datetime
- **Missing Appointments**: Graceful handling of non-existent appointment IDs
- **Self-Exclusion**: Correctly excludes current appointment when rescheduling

### 5. Next Available Slot Logic
- **15-minute Intervals**: Finds slots in standard booking increments
- **Multi-day Search**: Looks up to 30 days ahead
- **Provider-specific**: Respects individual provider schedules
- **Conflict Avoidance**: Skips over existing appointments
