# Deployment Instructions

## GitHub Repository Setup

Since the current GitHub token doesn't have repository creation permissions, please follow these steps to deploy the project to GitHub:

### Option 1: Create Repository via GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Set repository name: `ai-voice-agent-appointment-system`
4. Set description: `AI Voice Agent Appointment Scheduling Backend for Windmill with Supabase integration`
5. Make it public (recommended) or private as needed
6. **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Option 2: Create Repository via GitHub CLI

```bash
gh repo create ai-voice-agent-appointment-system --public --description "AI Voice Agent Appointment Scheduling Backend for Windmill with Supabase integration"
```

### Push the Code

After creating the repository, run these commands from the project directory:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-voice-agent-appointment-system.git

# Push the code
